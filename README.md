# hello-lift-rest-ws
POC of a Hello World REST web service using Scala and the Lift framework.

### Goal and purpose

The goal is to create a simple web service, that given a name returns "Hello \<name>!" or "Hello World" if no name is given.

The purpose of this project is to personally get acquainted with Scala and Lift in order to build REST web services for future professional development.
